# FlappyBird SQL Project

## Description
This project demonstrates fundamental SQL operations using a FlappyBird game dataset.  
It includes creating a table, inserting data, altering table structure, updating records, deleting records, and querying with aggregation.

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- CREATE TABLE to define a table
- INSERT INTO to add records
- ALTER TABLE to add a new column
- UPDATE to modify data
- DELETE to remove records
- SELECT queries with GROUP BY

## Dataset
- Each row represents a game session for a player.
- Columns include:
  - score: The score achieved in the session
  - highscore: The player's highest score
  - times_played: Total sessions played
  - bird_colour: Color of the bird used
  - player_ranking: Ranking assigned after updates

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `flappybird_project.sql` in a SQL client (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
3. Run queries sequentially to create the table, insert data, update rankings, and delete entries.

## Notes
- This project is intended to practice table manipulation, updating, and basic queries.
- Demonstrates handling real-world game data in SQL.
